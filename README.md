<h1 align="center"> Neural Model for Joint Learning of NER & Word Segmentation in Sanskrit <h1>

## Project Summary ##
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as person names, locations, and organizations. While this
task has been studied extensively for many languages, there are still challenges when it comes to low-resource languages such as Sanskrit. Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, poses unique challenges in NER due to its complex morphology, lack of
standardization, and word segmentation issues. In this paper, we create a comprehensive annotated dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Word Segmentation tasks in Sanskrit and evaluate the performance of existing NER models on
this dataset. The main contribution of this work is the classification of 10K names from Mahabharata into three categories, namely PER, LOC, and MISC. Various Deep Learning models based on Bidirectional LSTM, CNN, and CRF with different embeddings at the token and character level, are applied to the dataset.
